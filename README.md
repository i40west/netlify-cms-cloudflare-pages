# netlify-cms-cloudflare-pages

[Decap CMS](https://www.decapcms.org) (formerly Netlify CMS) needs to authenticate to Github with OAuth. Github needs a server to talk to during the authentication process. If youâ€™re hosting at Netlify, they take care of that. If not, youâ€™re on your own, and the documentation is... imperfect. ðŸ˜‚

If youâ€™re deploying to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) this may be the code youâ€™re looking for. It provides API endpoints for Github to talk to, running on Cloudflare Functions. Functions are kind of like Cloudflare Workers, but they run right from your Pages site.

## Credits
This is based on [d3v1an7/netlify-cms-oauth-cloudflare](https://github.com/d3v1an7/netlify-cms-oauth-cloudflare) adapted for Cloudflare Functions. 

## Installation

### 1. Create OAuth application at Github

Go to Settings -> Developer Settings and choose [OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers). Create a new OAuth App. Name it anything you like. **Homepage URL** should be set to your siteâ€™s URL. **Authorization callback URL** is the important part; it, too, can be set to your homepage URL (like `https://example.com`). Other guides say to set this to the callback API endpoint, but the documented requirement is that the callback URL be a subdirectory of this URL, and using the callback URL itself didnâ€™t work for me.

Github will give you a **Client ID**, and you can generate a **Client Secret** at this time. You will need both.

### 2. Add Client ID and Secret to your Cloudflare project

In your Cloudflare Pages project, go to Settings -> Environment variables. Add two environment variables, **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID** set to the client ID from above, and **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET** set to the secret.

### 3. Add the files to your project

Take the `functions` directory from this repo and add it to your project at the top level. **NOTE:** This means the actual top-level of the project itself, _not_ the top level of your output directory. So, if youâ€™re using Hugo, `functions` goes at the top of the project next to `content` and `layouts` and `archetypes` and so forth, _not_ inside the `static` or `assets` directory.

If you havenâ€™t already installed the Decap CMS files, take the `static/admin` directory from this repo and add it to your `static` directory (for Hugo) or wherever you add files to be deployed as-is to your site. There are two files under `admin`, a stub HTML file that loads the CMS, and the CMS config file `config.yml`. You can change the name of the `admin` directory.

The config file included here is a starter file only; you need to set this up for your site, which is beyond the scope of these instructions. However, you must set `base_url` in this config to the URL of your site (like `https://example.com`). Setting `auth_endpoint` here is optional because the default path works for the way this repo is set up.

### 4. Profit!

Publish your site and let Cloudflare build it. Go to `/admin/` on your site, and you should see a Login with Github button, which should authenticate you to Github and launch the CMS.
